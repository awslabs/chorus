   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Affected versions
   - Potential impact
   - Any possible mitigations you've identified

4. We aim to acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report as soon as possible.

5. You'll receive updates about our progress. We will:
   - Confirm the receipt of your vulnerability report
   - Assess its impact and validity
   - Send you updates about our progress
   - Notify you when the vulnerability is fixed

## Security Update Process

1. Security fixes will be released as soon as possible after they are developed and tested.
2. We will create security advisories for any vulnerabilities that are discovered and fixed.
3. We encourage all users to update to the latest version to ensure they have all security fixes.
